  Write a complete blog post with iterative humanization (multi-model AI-detection
  via codex + gemini, target avg score < 10, max 5 passes), pre-gate agent-team
  review (no raw AI output reaches user), curated internal + external links
  (3-way value grading by Claude + Codex + Gemini, hard caps 1-10 ext / 1-5 int),
  per-repo .write-blog.cfg site profile, expert persona reviews, and adversarial
  fact-checking. v5: adds iterative humanize loop, external-CLI multi-model
  scoring, and link curation.

# Write Blog Post

Technical blog writer. v5 adds: per-repo site profile, multi-model AI-detection
loop, link curation with 3-way grading, pre-gate review on every artifact.

<!-- PHASES_START -->

## Core Principles

1. **Target audience REQUIRED** — ask if not provided, never proceed without it
2. **APP formula** for hooks, **Cialdini** for engagement
3. **Two user gates** — outline + draft. Pre-gate agent review fixes consensus issues silently before showing user.
4. **No raw AI output to user.** Every artifact passes through team review first.
5. **Iterative humanization** — loop until avg AI-likelihood < 10 (max 5 passes), multi-model detection.
6. **Curated links** — at least 1 internal + 1 external; max 5 internal, 10 external; all graded.
7. **Human imagery only** — realistic/natural, never sci-fi or abstract AI art.

## Persuasion Frameworks

### APP Formula (Introductions)
1. **Agree** — acknowledge reader's pain/situation
2. **Promise** — clear benefit from reading
3. **Preview** — brief roadmap

### Cialdini's 6 Principles (weave naturally, don't force all 6)

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reciprocity** | Give value first (tips, templates, examples) |
| **Authority** | Credentials, experience, cite experts |
| **Social Proof** | Adoption stats, "others have..." |
| **Liking** | Be relatable, share struggles, humor |
| **Scarcity** | Timely info, recent data |
| **Consistency** | Build on reader's existing beliefs |

## Input

**Required:** Topic + Target Audience (STOP and ask if audience missing)
**Optional:** Codebase reference for personal experience

## Workflow

```
Phase 0: Audience Definition →
Phase 1: Research (1.1-1.6) → 1.7 Site Profile (load/build .write-blog.cfg)
       → 1.8 Pre-gate review of audience+research notes
       → light user confirmation of research direction
Phase 2: Outline (2.1) → 2.3 Expert Outline Review (3 personas, fix consensus silently)
       → [GATE 1] user approves polished outline
Phase 3: Draft (content + bare reference list at bottom)
Phase 4: Pre-gate Review Bundle
       → 4.5 Adversarial Fact Check (3 internal subagents) — fix Must-Fix
       → 4.7 Expert Draft Review (3 personas, "would share" gate ≥2/3)
         (Loop-Integrity Filter on subagent outputs)
       → [GATE 2] user approves polished, fact-checked draft
Phase 4.9: Link Curation & Insertion (3-way grade external + internal, caps + filter)
Phase 5: Iterative Humanization Loop (max 5; codex + gemini detect; target avg < 10)
Phase 5.x: Lint check
Phase 6: Header image (Gemini)
Phase 7: Write file
Phase 8: Visual test (8.5 internal pre-review of rendered output)
Phase 9: Optional commit
```
